Fix Magit on Windows taking a long time to open a buffer for writing commit messages.

In my case the time between pressing c c in the Magit buffer and opening the COMMIT_EDITMSG buffer improved from 8 seconds to 0.5 seconds.

* Limitations

- Some config and directory structure information in git repositories is cached. You need to manually clear the cache or rerun magit-status when changing.
- No support for special kinds of repositories.(Using bare repositories, the environment variable GIT_DIR, etc)
- Buffer to edit commit message is in fundamental-mode.
- bug-reference-mode is not available.
- Don't colorize local and remote branch names.
- There may be something else.

* Usage

#+begin_src elisp
(with-eval-after-load "magit"
  (require 'my-magit-sppedup-settings))
#+end_src
